# Longest Common Subsequence
## LCS Problem Statement: 
Given two sequences, find the length of longest subsequence present in both of them. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order, 
but not necessarily contiguous. For example, “abc”, “abg”, “bdf”, “aeg”, ‘”acefg”, .. etc are subsequences of “abcdefg”.

### Examples
LCS for input Sequences “ABCDGH” and “AEDFHR” is “ADH” of length 3. 

LCS for input Sequences “AGGTAB” and “GXTXAYB” is “GTAB” of length 4. 

#### Optimal Substructure: 
Let the input sequences be X[0..m-1] and Y[0..n-1] of lengths m and n respectively. And let L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) be the length of LCS of the two sequences X and Y. Following is the recursive definition of L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]).

If last characters of both sequences match (or X[m-1] == Y[n-1]) then 
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = 1 + L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-2])

If last characters of both sequences do not match (or X[m-1] != Y[n-1]) then 
L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-1]) = MAX ( L(X[0..m-2], Y[0..n-1]), L(X[0..m-1], Y[0..n-2]) )

            for (int j = 1; j <= y; j++) {
                if (s1[i - 1] == s2[j - 1])
                    dp[i%2][j] = 1 + dp[(i-1)%2][j - 1];
                else
                    dp[i%2][j] = _max(dp[(i-1)%2][j], dp[i%2][j - 1]);
            }
        }
        return dp[x%2][y];
